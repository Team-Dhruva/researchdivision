# Type II Civilization - Stellar  power  
---
A Type II civilization extends its reach beyond just one planet, harnessing the power of its entire solar system. Imagine a society so advanced that they can build enormous structures like Dyson Spheres, which capture solar energy directly from the sun. With this kind of technology, colonizing other planets and moons becomes not just possible but routine.

What would life be like in such a civilization? Advanced space travel would be commonplace, and interplanetary travel would be as routine as today’s air travel. Imagine living in space habitats orbiting planets, with the ability to terraform other worlds to support human life. The focus would shift from just surviving on Earth to thriving throughout the solar system.

What drives this level of progress? It's about major breakthroughs in engineering and space travel, developing massive space habitats, and a mindset that’s eager to explore and expand. With every new discovery, we’d push the boundaries of what’s possible and turn the dream of a multi-planetary existence into reality. How would it feel to wake up every day knowing you’re part of a civilization that spans the stars? Feels great isn’t it?
