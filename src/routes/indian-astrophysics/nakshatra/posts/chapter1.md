For as long as humans have gazed at the night sky, we’ve been fascinated by the starry patterns that stretch across it. The people of ancient India noticed certain groups of stars that appeared together and reappeared at the same time each year. These repeating patterns sparked a need to organise the sky, leading to the creation of a system called nakshatras - regions marked by a grouping of specific stars.

The moon’s path across the sky was interpreted as a journey through 27 different nakshatras, and ancient astronomers used these patterns to trace the passage of time, thereby gaining the ability to predict seasons, and plan essential activities like planting of crops. By dividing the sky in this manner, they were able to turn a seemingly random collection of white dots in the sky into a structured, predictable system that helped connect the movements of the cosmos to life on Earth.

Their observations suggested that it takes the Moon a little more than 27 days to have the exact same backdrop of stars again. We now know that the period of orbit of the Moon around the Earth is 27 days, 7 hours and 43 minutes. Rounding down to 27, we can thus say that the nakshatra of any particular day is the major star cluster, identified by ancient Indians, acting as the backdrop of the Moon on the night sky of that day.

To create a systematic way of tracking the Moon's movement, the astronomers divided the entire path of the Moon (the 360-degree space) into 27 equal segments. Each nakshatra thus occupies exactly 13 degrees 20 minutes of the celestial arc. This precise mathematical division shows remarkable astronomical sophistication - considering the tools available at the time, their calculations came very close to mapping the actual lunar orbit.

Interestingly, ancient astronomers grouped these stars based on thoughtful criteria like brightness, visibility, and their position along the Moon’s path in the sky. While some nakshatras align with well-known constellations, where stars form distinctive arrangements (like Orion), others don’t form such perfect shapes. Each Nakshatra holds its own unique significance, contributing a distinct influence within the cosmic order. Together, they form a celestial framework that has guided traditions, beliefs, and observations for millennia.

The 27 nakshatras are -
